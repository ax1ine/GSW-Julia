This Julia implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based primarily on wrappers of the GSW-C implementation (https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C).

The original Gibbs-SeaWater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox contains the TEOS-10 subroutines for evaluating the thermodynamic properties of pure water (using IAPWS-09) and seawater (using IAPWS-08 for the saline part). Additional information can be obtained  on teos-10.org.

Function names, as well as most argument names, match those used in the TEOS-10 documentation (http://www.teos-10.org/pubs/gsw/html/gsw_contents.html).

If you use the GSW Oceanographic Toolbox the authors of the original toolbox ask that you include a reference to McDougall and Barker (2011), whose full citation is:
